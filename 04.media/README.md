For project no.4, I want to make a surreal point-and-click adventure based off of my home-town. This idea was inspired by https://cloud.radical-openness.org/lost.html, created by Sai Bao & Yang Mu. One thing I really like was that the website has a 'dreamy' aesthetic, and the storyline is non-linear and obstract, like a dream. 

In this project, all of the images used are either my own or taken from my family album. I wanted the assets to be personal, almost like you are looking into bits and pieces of my childhood memories. I want the 'player' to jump from one place to the next, with an abstract storyline. To me, it didn't really matter if the events made sense; I wanted to capture the feeling of nostalgia and also my culture. 

Because of time, I did not manage to finish this project. However, this is still an idea that I want to explore in the future.
