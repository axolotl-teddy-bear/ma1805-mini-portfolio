I poured the most time and effort into making this project. I knew i wanted to make somthing that was about my culture, so i just had fun with differnt ideas and themes. this project is a lion head that changes colours randomly whenevr the screen is clicked, with a gif of a dragon dance in the background. the lion head is a major part of chinsese holidays and clebration, symbolising good luck and the start of a new year. using this imagery as a starting point, I wanted to convey the loud and colourful atmosphere that comes with chinsese celebrations. the backgroud serves the purpose of creating a setting, and the random colours are inspired by the varity of lion costumes in terms of color. whilst the tradiaional color of the lion is alwyas red, it has branched out into all colors of the rainbow as the tradidion develops.
