I knew I wanted to make something that was about my culture, so I just had fun with different ideas and themes for this project. This project is a lion head that changes colours randomly whenever the screen is clicked, with a GIF of a dragon dance in the background. The lion head is a major part of Chinese holidays and celebrations, symbolising good luck and the start of a new year. Using this imagery as a starting point, I wanted to convey the loud and colourful atmosphere that comes with Chinese celebrations. The background serves the purpose of creating a setting, and the random colours are inspired by the variety of lion costumes in terms of colour. Whilst the traditional colour of the lion is always red, it has branched out into all colours of the rainbow as the tradition develops.
