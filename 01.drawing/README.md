Background info: I've never coded in HTML, JavaScript, or p5js before. But, I have taken a class in computer science in Y12, where I learnt a language called Pyret. I wouldn't say I'm an advanced programmer, but I'm familiar with the process, I'd say.



When I ran errands with my parents as a kid, I always felt a strange sense of guilt in the local market. Where I'm from (Macau), vendors would slaughter fish right in front of the customer as a way to guarantee freshness. Sometimes, shelled animals such as shrimp would even get packaged live into a plastic bag, then killed in the cooking pot. When I see the fish, stuffed into tiny tanks just to wait for the slaughter, I feel pity and anxiety for the animal. However, I am in no way a vegan. Despite seeing the horrible conditions that these animals are kept in, I still consume.

In this sense, I become both the observer and the fish itself in the emoji. This emoji captures the feeling of anxiety, making the viewer embody themselves as the fish trapped inside the blender. Simultaneously, the emoji also captures the feeling of being an outsider to the situation. Do you press the button to put it out of its misery, or would you just observe?
